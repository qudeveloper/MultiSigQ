[![Draft](https://img.shields.io/badge/Draft-UNOFFICIAL-red.svg)]() Disclaimer This repository is a draft and not officially endorsed, but it can be used as a boilerplate for your projects. Feel free to use it as is, but please note that it may not be fully polished or tested.

## Introduction
---------------

This repository contains a multi-signature wallet contract for the Qubic network, a decentralized platform for building scalable and secure applications. The contract allows multiple parties to jointly manage a wallet, requiring a minimum number of signatures to authorize transactions.

## Functionality
--------------

### Multi-Signature Wallet

*   Create a multi-signature wallet with a minimum number of required signatures
*   Add and manage multiple owners and their corresponding public keys
*   Set the minimum number of required signatures for transactions
*   Authorize transactions with multiple signatures

### Security Features

*   Implement secure multi-party computation to protect sensitive data
*   Use advanced cryptographic algorithms to ensure the integrity of transactions

## Installation
--------------

### Prerequisites

*   Qubic network node (version 1.0 or higher)

### Building and Deploying the Contract

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/qudeveloper/MultiSigQ.git`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Compile the contract: `npx qubic-compiler compile QubicMultiSigContract.cpp`
4.  Deploy the contract: `npx qubic-deploy deploy QubicMultiSigContract.bin`

## Usage
-----

### Creating a Multi-Signature Wallet

1.  Create a new wallet: `npx qubic-cli create-wallet --owners <owner1>,<owner2>,... --required-signatures <min-signatures>`
2.  Add owners and set the minimum number of required signatures: `npx qubic-cli update-wallet --owners <owner1>,<owner2>,... --required-signatures <min-signatures>`

### Authorizing Transactions

1.  Create a new transaction: `npx qubic-cli create-transaction --from <wallet-address> --to <recipient-address> --amount <amount>`
2.  Sign the transaction: `npx qubic-cli sign-transaction --transaction-id <transaction-id> --owner <owner-address>`
3.  Authorize the transaction: `npx qubic-cli authorize-transaction --transaction-id <transaction-id> --signatures <signature1>,<signature2>,...`
